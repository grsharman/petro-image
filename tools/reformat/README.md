# JSON Reformatter

This tool converts a JSON file of samples from the unnamed initial format to
version 1. The details of this transformation are laid out in
[petro-image#53](https://github.com/grsharman/petro-image/pull/53).

If you have [Rust installed](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/), you can run
the tool from this directory using:

```
cargo run <input file> <output file>
```
